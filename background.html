                Hi there! I am Yong Shen Wong, a software engineer and designer. I am currently a student at the University of Oklahoma studying Computer Science. I am passionate about creating software that is user-friendly and visually appealing. I am also interested in learning about new technologies and how they can be used to solve real-world problems. In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball, watching movies, and traveling. I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a software engineer and designer. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or check out my GitHub profile!

                    My biggest achievement so far is getting to watch the OKC Thunder play live at the Chesapeake Energy Arena. It was an amazing experience and I hope to go back again soon!
