                Welcome to my website! My name is Yong, and I am an aspiring software engineer and developer from Malaysia. I am currently in my senior year, pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at the University of Central Oklahoma. This marks my second year living in the United States, and over time, I have grown to appreciate both the culture and the work-life environment here. When I am not working on personal projects, I enjoy spending time with my friends or engaging in sports like golf and basketball.

                    One of my greatest dreams came true when I had the opportunity to watch an NBA game live. As a passionate fan of the Oklahoma City Thunder, I was thrilled to see them play at the Chesapeake Energy Arena. The entire experience—from the electrifying atmosphere to the intensity of the game—was truly breathtaking. I look forward to the day OKC wins its first championship and hope to witness that moment in person.

                    I have a strong passion for full-stack development and have been working on several projects that I’m proud of. One of them is a website for a local Chinese restaurant, which I have been developing over the past few months. Additionally, I am working on an AI chatbot designed to support veterans struggling with depression, with the hope that it can provide assistance in their time of need. Beyond these, I am continuously exploring new projects that challenge me and help refine my skills as a developer.
