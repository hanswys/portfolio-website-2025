                Thanks for visiting my website! My name is Yong, and I am a first-generation Computer Science graduate from the University of Central Oklahoma. I’m originally from Malaysia and have been living in Edmond, Oklahoma, for about two years. I’m a software developer/engineer with a passion for creating innovative solutions to real-world problems while making the experience fun and memorable.

                    I focus most of my time on full-stack web development. I have been working on recent projects using the MERN stack while incorporating different React component libraries such as Chakra UI and Shadcn to enhance my UI skills. I am also learning different front-end frameworks, specifically Angular.  I am also currently enrolled in the summer courses for mobile development by CodePath to expand my skills in mobile development.

                    I’m a huge believer in the American Dream. My parents sacrificed their time and effort to give me the opportunity to be the first in our family to study abroad and earn a degree. I’m excited to be part of the tech industry and look forward to what the future holds. I’m always open to new opportunities and challenges, so feel free to reach out if you have any questions or just want to chat!
