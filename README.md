Hi, I'm Kelly and I study Computer Science at UCLA! I'm currently in between my Bachelor's and Master's degree (expected: June 2026) and I'm looking for opportunities this summer to innovate for an impact! I love working on projects where I know the product I'm building will help my community grow with me.

I'm especially interested in frontend/full stack web and mobile app development. I have experience with backend, like working with databases and APIs, but I really like collaborating with product designers to improve the user interface and user experience. I've worked on apps for areas like sustainability, politics, and physical therapy, but my favorite project would have to be Pocket Studio. I led a team of developers and collaborated with designers, illustrators, and writers to craft a Swift iOS app that encourages users to practice mindfulness through infinite zoom art and storytelling.

Aside from that, I love getting creative during my free time. I enjoy dancing, filmmaking, graphic designing, bulley journaling, and more. I love exploring different mediums to express myself and connect with the people around me.
